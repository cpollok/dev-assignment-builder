# Unity Dev Assignment - Builder Game
A simple game prototype I made for an assignment.

You control a character that can give order to their followers by giving them an example of what to do.

When you start hacking trees, they will start hacking trees. When you pick up wood, they pick up wood, etc.

All of the assets and code were created by me.

Controls
--------
WASD - Movement

Space - Action 1 (Swing Axe)

Left Ctrl - Action 2 (Pick Up Wood)

You can store the wood in the cart by pressing either Space or Left Ctrl when standing close to and facing it.
